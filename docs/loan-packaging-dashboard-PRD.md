# 📄 Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## Feature: Loan Packaging & Brokering Dashboard  
**Product**: Business Lending Advocate (BLA)  
**Owner**: Jonathan Aranda  
**Version**: v1.1  
**Status**: Development-ready

## 🎯 Purpose

Build a secure, guided dashboard experience that helps small business owners organize and submit lender-ready documentation for financing. Depending on the selected service type — `loan_packaging` or `loan_brokering` — users will either:

- Receive a downloadable and shareable loan package, or  
- Submit their documents to the BLA team, who will manage lender matchmaking.

The platform should be simple, professional, highly intuitive, and designed to reduce user friction while maximizing confidence, clarity, and conversion.

## 👤 Target Users

- Small business owners with limited technical knowledge
- Users who are applying for funding and want help organizing required documents
- People who value step-by-step support, clear progress tracking, and secure file handling
- Users who appreciate smart automation but prefer human-friendly language

## 🧭 High-Level User Flow

1. **User logs in** via SupabaseAuth  
2. **Selects service type + loan purpose** and proceeds through a payment or agreement step  
3. **Redirected to the dashboard** with dynamic checklist and floating progress tracker  
4. **Uploads or generates each document** (with templates, file upload, or AI generation)  
5. **Generates and edits Cover Letter**
