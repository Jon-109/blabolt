```typescript
from: 'Business Lending Advocate <onboarding@resend.dev>'

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Update Email Domain

   - Go to [Resend Dashboard](https://resend.com/domains)
   - Add `businesslendingadvocate.com`
   - Verify DNS records

2. **Update the API route** (`/app/api/send-contact-email/route.ts`):
   ```typescript
   from: 'Contact Form <noreply@businesslendingadvocate.com>'
   ```

## üîß How to Use

### Opening the Modal
The modal can be triggered by setting `isContactModalOpen` state to `true`:

```tsx
const [isContactModalOpen, setIsContactModalOpen] = useState(false);

<button onClick={() => setIsContactModalOpen(true)}>
  Contact Us
</button>

<ContactFormModal 
  isOpen={isContactModalOpen} 
  onClose={() => setIsContactModalOpen(false)} 
/>
```

### Adding More CTAs
To add the contact form to other pages:

1. Import the component:
```tsx
import ContactFormModal from '@/app/(components)/shared/ContactFormModal';
```

2. Add state management:
```tsx
const [isContactModalOpen, setIsContactModalOpen] = useState(false);
```

3. Add the modal and trigger button:
```tsx
<button onClick={() => setIsContactModalOpen(true)}>
